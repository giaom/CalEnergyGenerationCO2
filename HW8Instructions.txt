Assignment 8. Final Project
Due Friday by 11:59pm Points 10 Submitting a file upload Available May 23 at 11am - Jun 8 at 11:59pm
For a final project, you get to work in teams of three or two to (1) come up with a Jupyter notebook with software for renewable energy project, (2) write the code, and (3) present results to the class.

Divide into teams
We’ll go through a process to put people in teams of three. If we need to, we’ll have one or two teams of two.

Come up with a project
Have your team brainstorm a project.

What technologies interest you?
What question could you answer?
What problem could you solve?
Have me approve the project. It’s important that it’s not too easy or too difficult. If you’re stuck:

Could you take an existing assignment and do more?
If totally stuck, I have a project idea for you. Just ask.
Code the project
You can refer to the assignments as a starting point. Look things up on the internet if you get stuck – that’s how we do it in real life. Python is often not obvious, but there are lots of examples out there.

Anaconda’s online Jupyter notebook has AI built into it, so you can try that. My experience is that it’s far from perfect, but can give you a starting point. There’s also ChatGPT and Google Gemini. You can always ask me or other teams for help.

Work together as "pair programming" or divide up the work and work independently, combining it later.

Presentation
Create a PowerPoint presentation with 3 to 6 slides that covers:

Who is on your team?
What problem did you solve?
How did you solve it?
Then lead us through your notebook and take questions.
